Communication with the microservice.

As one can not trust the client, no direct connection is made.
The microservice only has two connections.
One being to a TCP routing server.
The other to a web interface.

This allows the microservices to split across multiple servers.
Also allows the routers to have fallback services if one dies.
But most importantly, the router verifies the client before relaying.
Thus one can not try to abuse the services without identifying.

Monitoring tools on the server can access logs async.
The database also allows for reading, but not writing.
Banning of users take place in the routing server.
