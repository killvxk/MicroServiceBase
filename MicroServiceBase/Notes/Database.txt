The microservices generally have two database connections.
A remote one that contains information about a user;
and a local one that contains all relevant information.

If the service handles authentication, then the local
database will have passwords and related information.
No other service or client has access to this database.

The remote database runs on MariaBD while the local uses
SQLite. This is to take advantage of the encryption in
MariaDB as well as having a low latency DB for the service.
