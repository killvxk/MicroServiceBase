# A base for internal microservices

This project serves as an introduction to the service system used in various projects.
It should be seen as a template given that only an example service module will be included.
However, it allows for community feedback regarding the system as a whole.
Hopefully it can serve as in inspiration for others.

# Implemented services

Each of my future projects will opensource a selection of services.
These will however only be available via the sites using them.
I do request that third party developers opensource their services, however, it's not a requirement.
The main purpose of it being opensource is to inspire anyways.

# Legal disclaimer

Given that I tend to get shit from lawyers for my tools, some general guidelines to use / view the code:
* Be 18 years or older (yes, I've had complaints).
* Not a citizen of a country that forbids you from looking at the code (yes, lawyers have told me I'm responsible for what you view).
* Don't plan on doing evil (ues, lawyers have told me I'm responsible for 'helping' bad people).

So ye, if you are human, you're probably not allowed to use any of my code.
But this is a readme, not a cop. It can't enforece any rules. 
But the legal disclaimer is here so I don't get more visits from angry lawyers.
